This Android application is a showcase and a portfolio, it represents a better way to implement
MVI with clean architecture.

## What's Left
This app is my play ground, I'll be adding new features and ideas regularly, but as for now, this is what I'm thinking of:
- Notifications - To notify the user about the time of his goals
- Make the user able to change the goal to an achievement
- Design - I believe I can do better in this
